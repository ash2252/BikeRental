* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Business Goal
- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
  It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features


## Conclusions
- Temperature has highest coefficient of .5026 . This means if temperature increases by one unit then Increase in rental will be .5026
- There are negative coefficients which suggest that if independant variable increases then dependant variable will decreases
- During Summer Season , Bike Rentals are more in demand
- Spring season has negative coefficients and negatively correlated to bike rentals. So we can give some offers there to increase the demand
- Now seeing to weathersit variable, we have got negative coefficients for Mist +cloudy and Lights now weather
